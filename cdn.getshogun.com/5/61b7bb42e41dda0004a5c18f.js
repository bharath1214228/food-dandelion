We settled on what I think is the perfect combination of crisp edges and soft insides. As for the chocolate chips, the factory didn't produce them yet, so we made our own.

Shortly after our Valencia Street café opened its doors in 2010 she did a pop-up in our pastry kitchen, and we’ve been dreaming of the baked goods and confections she made when she was behind the stoves ever since. Her Brazilian cheese bread? Legendary. Her fresh fig and chocolate ganache galette? We’d do anything for a crumb. But every time we’ve thought about her chocolatey, creamy brigadeiros (pronounced bree-guh-DAY-rows) over the years, we’ve gotten more than a little swoony. (Oh, and by the way, Todd once made his own brigadeiros with cocoa powder he made himself instead of nibs. Have a look at his recipe for Black and White Brigadeiros from the vaults.)</p><p>\nLet us explain.. Brigadeiros are an extremely popular truffle-like confection from Kika’s native Brazil that everyone makes at home for parties or special occasions. They’re as popular as chocolate-chip cookies. Usually they’re overwhelmingly dense and sweet from concentrated sweetened condensed milk and sweet chocolate, but we love Kika’s version because the sweetness is really tame, the texture melts in your mouth, and the flavor truly highlights the chocolate. What’s not to love, really? It’s our single-origin chocolate made fudgey and creamy as it’s ever been. Then Kika rolls each brig with nutty cocoa nibs for crunch (and to keep your fingers from getting too chocolatey!). This recipe quite literally puts our chocolate into your hands, so you can make the shape as elegant as you want it, or just free form it with kids in the kitchen.</p><p>\nOh, and just a word about Chef’s Chocolate. If you’ve never baked with our Chef’s Chocolate before, it’s super easy to use. Chef’s Chocolate is not cocoa powder. It’s the same 70% cocoa-beans-and-sugar-only chocolate we use for making bars, but it’s ground until into lentil-sized pieces and it’s not tempered (meaning it’s not snappy and shiny). And rather than having to stop and chop it like baking chocolate, it’s designed to go anywhere chocolate chips can go, and melt really fast for any drink or pastry that calls for melted chocolate. This is what we use in our own pastry kitchens for our hot chocolate drinks and pastries.

He’s a bit of a kitchen wizard, and we’re really excited every time he brings a new adventure to the table, like this one. And ICYMI, check out his primer on smoking meat with cacao husk, and making charcoal too!</p><p>\nWhen I was interviewing to be an apprentice chocolate maker here last year, I’m pretty sure I spent more time talking about dim sum, baos, and dumplings than I did talking about the job I was applying for.</p><p>\nThat’s because prior to making chocolate here, I spent most of my free time making soup dumplings, or xiaolongbao (小笼包). Soup dumplings are pretty much exactly what they sound like: starchy balloons filled with hot soup. It sounds like a bit of an impossible trick, but the principle behind them is actually pretty simple; when you make the stock for these dumplings by boiling bones with aromatics, all the yummy collagen seeps out of the bones you’re simmering (or pig’s ears and chicken feet in my case) and turns into a firm jelly that you can mash up and integrate into your dumpling filling. Once you steam the dumplings, all that jelly melts back down into stock. Magic!</p><p>\nAt some point, I got the idea to try this out with things other than stock, including, of course, chocolate. Soup dumplings are nearly always savory, and I really wanted to try making a sweeter equivalent. Eventually, this idea mutated into something else because when I tried to make soup dumplings filled with ganache, they were very leaky. And so, I resorted to another more durable dough: bao.</p><p>\nBao dough is that fluffy, soft, shiny dough that you’ll sometimes find taco’d or totally wrapped around pork belly. It’s a kind of Chinese dumpling, sort of, and it seemed like a much more durable skin for a ganache-filled masterpiece than thin, traditional dumpling dough. And, it worked! There are a few ways you could do this, but you’ll find my favorite method below.</p><p>\nYou can also riff on this method using any filling that’s somewhat solid when cool, and liquid when hot. The principle is always the same: make the filling, cool it down to solidify it, wrap the dough around it, and when ready to serve, heat it back up. (You can make loads of them and keep them in the freezer, too.)</p><p>\nTypically, these buns are steamed, but I don’t have a steamer so borrowed a trick from making gyoza (or potstickers) and pan-fried the buns in oil for a nice crispy, caramelized edge. Then, I spooned a little water into the hot pan with the dumplings and capped it real quick to seal in all that steam. This steams and cooks the buns and the filling, and after all the water boils off, the leftover oil crisps up the bottom of the bun.</p>","author":"Richard Huynh","team":"pastry kitchen","creator":"Richard Huynh","recipeCategory":"dessert"},"ChocolateBourbonPecanPie":{"id":"ChocolateBourbonPecanPie","name":"MEREDYTH'S CHOCOLATE BOURBON PECAN PIE","headline":"Meredyth's Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie","keywords":"chocolate, bourbon, pecan pie","text":"This recipe comes from our pastry sous chef, Meredyth Haas, who adapted it from her grandmother's cookbook, Death by Chocolate by Marcel Desaulniers.

The secrets to a good canelé are locked in a vault somewhere in Bordeaux, or at least that’s how the story goes. These palm-size baked custard cakes blend two opposing textures, and the hallmarks of a good bake are the shining, crackling, nearly blackened crust of caramelized sugar with a pillowy soft interior.</p><p>\nThis recipe requires two unusual items: copper molds and beeswax (which is edible!). Together, these two things give canelés their sheen and hard crust, and although the molds are expensive, you won’t find a substitute that works nearly as well.</p><p>\nThere are a few tricks to making a good canelé. First off, 2-inch copper molds work best—no substitutions! If you are using new copper molds, I recommend seasoning them by brushing them generously with vegetable oil and placing them in a 300°F oven for 1 hour, then remove them molds from oven and cool them completely. Wipe the inside of each mold with a clean towel. Now they are ready for baking, and you will prepare the copper molds with an even, paper-thin coat of butter and beeswax in a way that doesn’t leave puddles or holes in the crust of the pastry, and flip them out of their molds while still hot. You want to bake them to the perfect threshold that crisps the crust without overbaking the custard inside.</p><p>\nIt’s important to make the canelé batter at least one day before you wish to bake them. The batter needs to rest and chill overnight to let the air settle out and to allow the flavors to develop and deepen; baking canelés with batter made the same day will result in a puffy, slumped, overflowing mess in your oven. A classic canelé is vanilla, but ours—of course—is chocolate.</p><p>\nAs for what kind of chocolate to use, rum, chocolate, and vanilla are the dominant flavors in this recipe, and warm notes—fudge, coffee, brown sugar, and caramel— seem to play off that combination the best. Anything fruity or tart might throw off the balance in that wonderful trio. </p>","author":"Lisa Vega","team":"pastry kitchen","creator":"Dandelion Chocolate","recipeCategory":"dessert"},"ChocolateCheese":{"id":"ChocolateCheese","name":"CHOCOLATE CHIBOUST, CINNAMON CARAMEL, GRUYERE STREUSEL, & MELTED RACLETTE CHEESE","headline":"Chocolate Chiboust, Cinnamon Caramel, Gruyere Streusel, & Melted Raclette Cheese","keywords":"chocolate, chiboust, cinnamon caramel, gruyere, streusel, raclette cheese","text":"<p>Celebrity Chef Elizabeth Falkner came to fame with renown pastry shop Citizen Cake in San Francisco, and she has gone on to become one of the most notable chefs and culinary innovators in America.

So I am a fiend for nuts and chocolate of any kind, and when it comes to chocolate and hazelnuts, even more so. I remember the first time I ever tasted brand name Nutella: I was on a school trip to Epcot Center in Disneyworld sometime in middle school and I bought a small packet of it in the little French village. (I know, I know…the stuff is actually Italian, but you’ll have to talk to Walt about the reorg on European food.) It was SO GOOD. Like, really good. I’m pretty sure I didn’t even eat it on bread or anything; it’s quite possible I just squeezed the entire contents of it into my mouth, then went back and tried to squeeze out some more.</p><p>\nFast forward to my college years and I became a Riot Grrl and completely engrossed in the DIY aesthetic of everything. I was making my own zines, cutting and duct taping my own clothes, and starting to make my own food (beyond instant Lipton Noodles & Sauce from a pouch). I began making my own condiments like ketchup and mustard and mayonnaise, and odd as it may sound, doing so felt like a very revolutionary act. I loved not being held to the confines of Kraft and ConAgra, and I loved the control that being in the kitchen and stocking my shelves gave me.</p><p>\nThis passion and food lust led to a career as a food writer and cookbook author, and that afforded me the luxury of being able to make more food my own way. I would find a product at the store, look at all the junk on the ingredient label, and then take pride and pleasure in recreating that recipe in my own kitchen with real food. Nutella, known in Italy as gianduja, and known in North America as chocolate hazelnut spread, was eventually checked off my list.</p><p>\nWhen Bloom, the chocolate salon inside our 16th Street Factory, was doing its friends and family meals, I tasted Lisa’s bruleed brioche with her take on a homemade “Nutella”. It’s sublimely creamy and entirely decadent. And on the sticks of crisp, sweet, enriched bread, it’s an exercise in rich. For chocolate enthusiasts and anyone with a sweet tooth, it is exceptional.</p><p>\nIn our book, Making Chocolate From Bean to S’more, Lisa and the kitchen team stuff this cream inside cookies, which seems like a dessert lover’s dessert. Meredyth was the first to think about making the chocolate hazelnut cream in a melanger, the stone-wheeled grinder that we use to make chocolate. I’m sure this is what gets our in-house version so super creamy; more so than most of us could accomplish at home.</p><p>\nFor those of us who don’t own our own melanger, we still have options; a food processor will also do the job. I have a version of the recipe in one of my cookbooks, but lately I’ve been making it even more simply and delicious.</p><p>\nI weigh the hazelnuts, toast them, and remove the skin; this is essential, as the skin is really bitter. While the nuts are still warm, I put them into the food processor with an equal weight of our Chef’s Chocolate. I blend it thoroughly, then add some salt and about ¼ cup good-quality extra virgin olive oil. Then I blend it for a long, long time—five minutes, at least—until it’s super smooth and liquidy. Once it’s scraped into a jar and refrigerated, the texture firms and it becomes quite smooth and spreadable, particularly once it hits warm toast. Try it also spread onto fruit or simply eaten from a spoon.</p><p>\nFor the real deal, though, follow our kitchen’s recipe below.

These are not for those avoiding gluten or dairy or sugar, and each time I make them I love the way the ooey, gooey caramel glaze on top counteracts the bitterness of the nibs I use in place of nuts. This recipe was adapted from Peter Reinhart’s excellent book, The Breadbaker’s Apprentice. I often use nibs in place of nuts when I’m baking, and I recommend anyone try it. Depending on where the cacao is from, they can add a ruddy earthiness, tart fruit notes, or smokiness, as well as a different kind of texture.</p><p>\nI’ve shared this recipe with others who haven’t been able to replicate the results, and I believe these three tips are what make these sticky buns extra delicious. Follow them for best results.</p><p>\nWeigh, don’t measure! After making these in a rental cabin where I didn’t have a scale, I can personally attest to this. Using a measuring cup, particularly for flour, can cause very different weights of flour to be used. For this recipe, you want to use as little as possible, or the dough will become dry and it’s very easy to use too much if you don’t weigh your flour. (The sticky buns will still be tasty, but results are always better when I weigh the ingredients).</p><p>\nThe Window Pane Test. This is a technique I learned from the Breadbaker’s Apprentice. To test if the gluten in the dough is relaxed enough, grab a piece of it and stretch it apart by four corners into a rectangle. If you can stretch it to a thinness that you can almost see through it like a window, its ready. If it tears or is too sticky to do so, the glutens are not relaxed enough and it’s not ready.</p><p>\nDelicious ingredients = delicious bread. I am a firm believer of the instructions my Great Gramma gave my dad when he wanted to learn her bread recipe: “If you use ‘good ingredients,’ the bread could not fail.” I’m lucky to live in San Francisco, where its easy to find fancy organic, local, pasture-raised, biodynamic ingredients. (Although it’s also a bit depressing that the chickens whose eggs I use have significantly more space to call their own than I could dream of here).\nCINNAMON. The one ingredient I never compromise on is Vietnamese cinnamon. It has a higher oil content than the average cinnamon bottle purchased at your typical grocery store, which means the cinnamon flavor is stronger and lingers longer than regular cinnamon.</p><p>\nEGGS. Even some friends who are used to San Francisco prices think I’m crazy for buying eggs that cost $1/egg. However, these eggs are not only more tasty, but also more nutritious. (And what else am I going to buy for $1?)</p><p>\nMILK AND BUTTER. Organic is okay, but at the risk of sounding like a Portlandia episode, the diet of the cows is more important since it determines the taste of their milk. I use whole milk and unsalted organic butter.</p><p>\nSUGAR, BROWN SUGAR, AND CORN SYRUP. The more stripped of colors these ingredients are, the less delicious flavors they have. I use Wholesome Sweetener’s Organic Fair Trade Sugar and their Corn Syrup (with vanilla) for the topping.</p><p>\nFLOUR. Flour quality is important. In the US, mass-produced flour is made by pulling apart wheat into its separate components, and then reassembling them. While this creates a uniform flavor, gluten content, and product, I prefer flour that is closer to its natural state, not processed and reorganized in order to make it all taste the same. It’s the same reason I appreciate single-origin chocolate, because terroir and genetics furnish food with particular tastes, and the fact that those are different is what makes it interesting to me. Good quality bread flour is available, but make sure to do some background checking. I use King Arthur unbleached bread flour for this recipe, but for the rest of my baking I like to use Community Grains hard red winter wheat.</p><p>\nNow, if you can’t find all of the best ingredients, just use as many as you can. This recipe is not the simplest of sticky bun recipes, but it’s worth it, I promise.</p>","author":"Cynthia Jonasson","team":"pastry kitchen","creator":"Dandelion Chocolate","recipeCategory":"dessert"},"NibbyToffee":{"id":"NibbyToffee","name":"DANDELION CHOCOLATE NIBBY TOFFEE","headline":"Dandelion Chocolate Nibby Toffee","keywords":"toffee, nibby","yield":"1 TOFFEE","text":"<p>This toffee is a longtime staple in our pastry kitchen, and for good reason.

Obviously I have you covered on Sourdough, whether you’ve never tackled it before or whether you want a new recipe to try, and of course banana bread isn’t anything new around here. Hopefully by combining the two I can show a really easy recipe that helps you use the discarded starter, preventing waste, and give you something easier to make than the sourdough itself.</p><p>\nBefore we get to the recipe lets talk about the sourdough starter and the discard we are going to be using. If you are using your starter on a daily basis you will have a lot of discard and you might not want to bake with that everyday. Thankfully the discard can be kept in the fridge for a few days, topping up each time you feed the starter, or you can even freeze it. When you come to use the discard it is still important to smell it, if there is any off notes, any unpleasant smells these may translate to flavour in your recipe. If you store your starter in the fridge however you won’t have as much discard, you’ve already reduced your waste by slowing down the fermentation meaning the starter needs a lot less feeding. When I store my sourdough baby in the fridge I find it needs two rounds of feeding to bring it back to health and guess what? If you are filling my feeding schedule, two feeds will give you 200g of discard and that is exactly what this recipe calls for, it’s almost like I planned it that way.</p><p>\nUsing sourdough discard in your recipes is also easier than you might think. Most sourdough starter recipes are made to be 100% hydration, that is to say with an equal weight of flour and water. This makes using the discard in a recipe straightforward because, say you have 100g of discard, you just divide the amount in half and take out 50g of flour and 50ml liquid from your existing recipe. Using discard in recipes like quick breads like banana bread or muffins, pancakes, waffles are the easiest things to use but you can even use it recipes such a chocolate cake, where the acidity would give a real boost to the chocolate flavour.</p>","author":"Edd Kimber","team":"The Boy Who Bakes","creator":"Edd Kimber","recipeCategory":"dessert"},"SpicedBananaBread":{"id":"SpicedBananaBread","name":"SPICED BANANA BREAD WITH COCOA NIBS","headline":"Spiced Banana Bread With Cocoa Nibs","keywords":"banana bread, cocoa nibs","image":"https://i2.wp.com/www.dandelionchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/nibby-bread.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://i2.wp.com/www.dandelionchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/nibby-bread.jpg","yield":"1 LOAF","text":"<p>Todd once mentioned that he makes banana bread with cocoa nibs.

So, I worked from recipes from MARTHA STEWART and SMITTEN KITCHEN, adding in our nibs.</p><p>\nThe bread was wonderful. The cocoa nibs softened in the oven, but maintained a bite.
